# 🎄 ISE: North Pole Protocol - The Glitch Elf's Revenge

## 📖 Narrative Storyboard
The North Pole's automation system has been compromised by a disgruntled former head-elf. All robot toys have turned hostile, and the "Spirit of Christmas" energy is being drained. Players must take control of a high-tech Guardian Elf to recover the energy and save the holiday.

### 👤 Characters & Abilities
* **Protagonist:** Guardian Elf (Equipped with a Snowball Blaster).
* **Movement:** Keyboard-based (`WASD`) for fluid PC-gamer navigation.
* **Abilities:** * **Precision Aim:** Uses **Motion Tracking** to follow the mouse cursor.
  * **Sugar Rush:** A temporary speed boost that leaves a **neon particle trail**.
  * **Stamina Management:** Players must balance exertion in high-heat areas.

### 🗺️ Environment & Levels
The game features a tutorial and 6 progressively difficult levels:
1. **Trial (Elf Bootcamp):** A safe "guide book" environment to learn movement and shooting mechanics.
2. **Level 1 (Snowy Courtyard):** Beginner level fighting slow-moving Ice Slimes.
3. **Level 2 (The Mail Room):** Fast-paced action where hitting flying letters provides speed boosts.
4. **Level 3 (Toy Assembly Line):** Event-driven gameplay involving moving conveyor belts.
5. **Level 4 (The Wrapping Station):** Obstacle-heavy arena requiring players to dodge sticky tape traps.
6. **Level 5 (Engine Room):** Expert level featuring steam vents and stamina-drain mechanics.
7. **Level 6 (The Main Vault):** Final Boss fight against a giant Robotic Nutcracker.

### ✨ Special Effects Plan
